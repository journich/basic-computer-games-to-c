Ports to C of Games from Basic Computer Games book by David H Ahl

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games

This was the book I first started learning about programming all the way
back in the early 1980's on a Microbee Computer with a Z80 CPU and 16K of ram.
 
The idea is to create a version of the 1970's Basic game in C
without introducing new features, using only core C code (hopefully)
making the game runnable on both modern computers and older computers
and even retro style recently released computers such as the Commander X-16.
No additional text, error checking, etc has been added. If there was a bug in
the current code, it remains in the new one.

Basic code tested with Vintage basic.
